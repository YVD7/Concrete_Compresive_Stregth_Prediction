# Concrete_Compresive_Stregth_Prediction
This is the first Machine Learning Internship Project. The subject of this project is "Concrete Compresive Stregth Prediction" which comes under infrastructure domain (Civil Engineering domain)  where we have to predict strength of cement using machine learning techniques.
